# **Ball Game MOBILE** :basketball:

This game was developed in Unity and C# language. 
It was inspired by a saga of video tutorials about **Unity 2D** that I saw in ***SkillShare*** allowing me to improve and acknowledge 2D topics.

## **Game Description**

It's a simple game for android where the player is a ball and has to avoid **triangles**, collect **coins** and **jump boosters** by pressing the finger into the screen and moving it to the sides. To use the jump boosters all that you have to do is to **`CLICK`** in the screen! 
In the shop menu, you can buy items from collecting coins.

## **Features**

- **`DONE`** Simple Shop System.
- **`DONE`** Coins and JumpBoosters System.
- **`DONE`** Settings to modify the in-game sound in general.
